This is an unfinished font based on 26 runes I found in a texture file from the game DOOM 2016.

The texture path is `generated/image/textures/sfx/demonrunes/drstrip.bimage` and it can be extracted
from the game files with "DOOM Resources Explorer".

Use Fontforge to open and edit the font source file.
